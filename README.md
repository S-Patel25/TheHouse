# TheHouse
The House is a small horror game project created in Unreal Engine 5 that I am currently developing! The story is that a delivery driver is called to a house to deliver a pizza, but as he walks in to deliver it, he gets locked inside the house. As he navigates the house trying to find a way outside, he discovers the horrors within.
