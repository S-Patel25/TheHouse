# TheHouse

The House is a small horror game project created in Unreal Engine 5 that I am currently developing! The story is that a delivery driver is called to a house to deliver a pizza, but as he walks in to deliver it, he gets locked inside the house. As he navigates the house trying to find a way outside, he discovers the horrors within. (Still a work in progress, will post updates as developement goes along)

# Features being worked on

Right now I'm working on the core game mechanics which is movement, lighting, making the ai, making gameplay mechanics that deal with picking up items, create notes for story purposes, planning out jumpscares and etc.

# Gameplay

Here is a small snippet of a current jumpscare, I'll add more updates as game progress furthers. (Player walks in to see a floating jar, as player gets closer, jumpscare occurs and the jar falls.) (Still WIP)
